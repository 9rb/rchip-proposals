<!-- This document is provided as a template to get you started. Feel free to add, augment, remove, restructure and otherwise adapt the structure for what you need. -->

<!-- RChip-NN TITLE -->
<!-- Enter proposal number and title as issue title. -->

## Introduction/Motivation/Abstract
<!-- Feel free to rename this section to Introduction, Motivation, Abstract, whatever best suits your library proposal.
Think of the introduction as serving to describe the library addition in a way that lets a reader decide if this is what they are looking for, whether they think this is the right approach to supply the extra functionality, and whether they might want to get involved. -->


## Motivating Examples

### Examples
<!-- Detailed description of how the enhancement functionality can be used.
Code heavy description for Rholang related features. -->

### Comparison Examples
<!-- Code demonstrating why the library is needed, how equivalent functionality might be provided without it. -->

### Counter-Examples
<!-- What the library is not intended to be used for. Examples of what to avoid and why. -->


## Design
<!-- Discuss design decisions (including, as examples):
* Reason about correctness of the implementation.
* “Feel and fit” with existing Rholang code.
* Performance and threading considerations.
* Impact to existing blockchain networks, hard fork conditions, etc. -->


## Counter-Examples
<!-- What the library is not intended to be used for. Examples of what to avoid and why. -->


## Drawbacks
<!-- Why should we not do this. Be honest, these questions will come out during the process anyway so it’s better to get them out up front. -->


## Alternatives
<!-- What other possibilities have been examined? What is the impact of not implementing this proposal? -->
